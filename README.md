# Project Title

How to predict soil organic carbon with machine learning method

## Summary

My project aims to develop a machine learning methods to predicting soil organic carbon with environmental covariates. The library includes data collecting, feature selection, model training, model testing, and finally we will get a spatial soil organic carbon map.


## Background

Soil organic carbon is a crucial component of soil health, influencing soil structure, nutrient availability, and water retention. Accurate prediction of soil organic carbon is important for sustainable land management, agriculture, and climate change mitigation. Traditional methods for measuring SOC are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often require chemical analyses. Machine learning offers a promising alternative by leveraging large datasets and advanced algorithms to predict SOC more efficiently and accurately.


## How is it used?

Data Collection and Processing

Data Acquisition: 
Download relevant data from the LUCAS database, including soil sample coordinates, soil properties.

Feature selection: 
Use some algorithms to select the most infomative environmental covariates

Model fitness
Fit model with some machine learning and deep learning methods

Perfromance test
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RÂ² and Root Mean Squared Error.

Spatial prediction
Predict in the spatial scale.

## Challenges

Get data, clear and predict
